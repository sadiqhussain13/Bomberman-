# Bomberman-
Look out for pierce bombs as they can explode through walls and potentially kill you when you least expect it.
Kicking bombs make them travel at very high speed so be prepared to dodge the explosion when you see another player kicking a bomb in your direction.
Powerups are destructible just like soft walls so if you end up coming across a powerup you don't need, consider using it as a shield against explosions that are not by pierce bombs.
Kicking bombs through powerups will destroy the powerup, this means you can deny another player from collecting a powerup if you are too far from it but have the kick ability.
Try baiting another player into a dead end and trapping them by placing a bomb to block them inside the dead end (will not work if they have kick).
